            <h3>Season Stories</h3>
            <h2>RCB's Comeback</h2>
            <p>Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) had an incredible comeback in the 2024 IPL season! After a rough start with seven losses in their first eight games, RCB managed to turn things around with six consecutive wins towards the end of the season. This remarkable turnaround not only secured them a spot in the playoffs but also ended Chennai Super Kings' title defense with a 27-run victory in their final league game</p>
            <h2>MI's Downfall</h2>
            <p>The 2024 IPL season was tumultuous for Mumbai Indians (MI). Facing early setbacks, they lost eight of their first nine games, which led to a swift removal of Rohit Sharma as captainâ€”sparking mixed reactions. Despite Hardik Pandya's leadership and some standout individual performances from Rohit Sharma, who scored 417 runs, and Jasprit Bumrah, who took 20 wickets, MI struggled to find consistent form. Their season was also marred by internal controversies and strategic missteps, leading to a disappointing finish at the bottom of the points table with only four wins out of 14 games.</p>
